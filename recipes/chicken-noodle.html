           <li>⅓ cup chopped fresh basil</li>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
       <ol>
       <li> Whisk garlic, rice vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, Sriracha, hoisin, and sesame oil together in a mixing bowl for the dressing.</li>

        
        <li>Tear chicken apart into strands similar in width to the spaghetti. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>

       
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, <br> until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.</li>

        
        <li>Transfer spaghetti to a mixing bowl; add the chicken, carrots, bell pepper, and green onions. <br> Pour in the dressing and toss by hand until well combined. <br> Seal the surface of the salad with plastic wrap and refrigerate, tossing occasionally, for 2 to 12 hours, the longer the better.</li>
        
        
        <li>Add peanuts, basil, mint, and cilantro to the salad. Toss well; taste and adjust for seasoning.</li>
    </ol>
